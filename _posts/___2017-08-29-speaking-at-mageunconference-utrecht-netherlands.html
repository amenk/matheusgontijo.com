title: Speaking at MageUnconference - Utrecht, Netherlands
---

Let's go <em>for the second time</em> to MageUnconference at The Netherlands!!! <i class="em em-flag-nl"></i> <i class="em em-flag-nl"></i> <i class="em em-flag-nl"></i>

I have been to the last edition <?php /* @TODO: LINK ANO PASSADO*/ ?> and this year was as good as the previous one!

When it goes to Magento events, projects and initiatives Dutchento is always doing a great job in the Netherlands! They organized the unconference and were capable to brought together lots of good Magento people.
