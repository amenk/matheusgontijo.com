<h2>City of São Paulo</h2>

<p>São Paulo is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the entire world. The "Financial Heart of Brazil" — as it is also known — has over <strong class="text-underline">21,000,000</strong> people! The majority of multinational companies have their national headquarters placed there. According to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers" target="_blank">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> (an eminent international economic consultant firm), São Paulo is the 10th richest city in the world, and is expected to be the 6th richest in 2025.</p>

<p>That being said, it's easy to realize that the demands related to technology there are many, and that opportunities are endless.</p>
