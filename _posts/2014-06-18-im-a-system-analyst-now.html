title: I'm a System Analyst now!
tags: graduation diploma

<p>After 3 years studying diligently, sacrificing myself, and abdicating of personal plans in order to acquire knowledge (classes, books, seminars), to refine my skills, and being involved in relevant discussions, I finally <strong>made it!</strong> Now I can be called a <strong>System Analyst!</strong></p>

<p>The great takeaway from the college for me was:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>How to <strong class="text-underline">NOT</strong> create a new software. The world is already <strong class="text-underline">full</strong> of software and doesn't need a brand new one. What the world needs instead are <strong class="text-underline">pragmatic solutions</strong> that will match thoroughly customers' needs, and through technology <strong class="text-underline">empower their business</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no doubts that all efforts will be rewarded at the right time. It was an incredible and important milestone in my life. I would like to thank my family for supporting me with such compasion throughout this challenging journey.</p>
