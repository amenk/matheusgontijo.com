title: Magento 2 - Working with Large Collections - PHP Fatal error&#58; Allowed memory size of XXXX bytes exhausted
tags: magento2 collections php-cli terminal
---

<p>In Magento 2, when you try to iterate collections with <code>500</code>, <code>3,000</code> or even <code>10,000</code> records that's all fine. Nonetheless the problem comes out when you have to do the same thing with larger collection as <code>100,000</code>, <code>500,000</code> ou even <code>10,000,000</code> records! Then you will run "out of memory".</p>

<p>The error message is something like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html white-space-normal">PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of XXXX bytes exhausted (tried to allocate XXXX bytes) in vendor/magento/zendframework1/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Pdo.php on line 228</pre>

<p>Well, there are several ways to solve it (really really many!), but Magento itself provide us a way which may be very useful to you:</p>

<p><code>\Magento\Framework\Model\ResourceModel\Iterator</code> has a function called <code>walk</code> and the idea behind is: instead of reading <strong>ALL THE DATA at once</strong>, it reads <strong>row-by-row</strong> and calls the <code>callback</code> function. Thus the "out of memory" issue don't come out any longer, since we are now consuming small chunk's of data!</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
public function iterator()
{
    // you can filter by attribute
    // $this
    //    ->collection // \Magento\Catalog\Model\ResourceModel\Product\Collection
    //    ->addAttributeToFilter('name', array('like' => '%samsung%'));

    $this
        ->iterator // \Magento\Framework\Model\ResourceModel\Iterator
        ->walk(
            $this->collection->getSelect(),
            array(array($this, 'callback'))
        );
}

public function callback($args)
{
    // load of the product
    $product = $this
        ->productRepository // \Magento\Catalog\Api\ProductRepositoryInterface
        ->getById($args['row']['entity_id']);

    // do whatever you want to with the $product
    print_r($product->debug());
}
</pre>

<p>Obviously it will take more time to process since it makes a full load of the product, but certainly it fits to most of the rules out there (as general background process, export/import, mass product updates) as opposed to just iterate the entire collection at once and get "out of memory" error.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/matheusgontijo/blog-examples/tree/master/2018-02-10-magento-2-working-with-large-collections-php-fatal-error-allowed-memory-size-of-xxxx-bytes-exhausted/MatheusGontijo/Iterator" target="blank">project on my GitHub</a> where you can download/clone and simply run the command <code>php bin/magento matheusgontijo:iterator</code> and have the a module running and then adjust for your needs.</p>

<p>I usually consulted Inchoo's blog post (<a href="http://inchoo.net/magento/working-with-large-magento-collections/" target="_blank">Working with large Magento collections</a>) but for Magento 1. As I haven't found anything similar to Magento 2, I decided to create this post. Hope I helped!</p>
